    "Our translation pipeline consists of the following tasks:\n",
    "- **Dataset loading**: Downloads and parses the Multi30K dataset used for translation.\n",
    "- **Tokenizer training**: Trains and saves a Byte Pair Encoding (BPE) Tokenizer used for text encoding and decoding.\n",
    "- **Dataset encoding**: Encodes the dataset with the trained BPE Tokenizer.\n",
    "- **Model training**: Trains the Transformer based Sequence to Sequence Model.\n",
    "- **Model selection**: Selects from all trained model variations (different hyperparameter sweeps) the best performing one based on the validation set.\n",
    "- **Model evaluation**: Evaluates the best performing model on the test set by calculating the test loss and the bleu score.\n",
    "\n",
    "With FluidML, all of these steps are naturally implemented as individual tasks which register their dependencies and are chained together to a task graph. This graph is then executed in parallel by FluidML and all results are stored persistently in a local file store (see the Storage section for details)."

    "## Storage - Saving Objects with FluidML\n",
    "\n",
    "Before we start with the implementation of our translation pipeline, we take a brief look at FluidML's storage API.  \n",
    "Out of the box FluidML provides three different storage options, which share the same interface (the interested user can implement his own storage, as long as the storage class inherits from `fluidml.storage.base.ResultsStore` and implements all abstract methods):\n",
    "- **InMemoryStore**: If no store object is provided, this is internally the default. Every saved object is stored in an in-memory manager dictionary, which is shared across all tasks and processes. Once the entire pipeline is executed, the results dictionary is returned to the user and it is the user's responsibility to actually save the results e.g. to disc. This store is only recommended for quick prototyping and small result objects, since intermediate task results cannot be stored persistently and the memory might not be sufficient to hold all task results.\n",
    "- **LocalFileStore**: A persistent file store implementation that out of the box supports saving files as .json and .pickle. It can be easily extended by the user to support arbitrary file types and save options.\n",
    "- **MongoDBStore**: A persistent MongoDBStore implementation, which stores saved objects as binary strings via GridFS in a Mongo DB.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this example we utilize the `LocalFileStore` and extend it with our own custom saving types.  \n",
    "In order to save an object within a task, one simply calls\n",
    "```python\n",
    "self.save(obj=model_state_dict, name=\"best_model\", type_=\"torch\", sub_dir=\"models\")\n",

    "Our dataset is encoded using the trained BPE tokenizers, so the next step is to train the actual translation model. We utilize the well known transformer architecture first described in the [Attention is all you need](https://papers.nips.cc/paper/2017/file/3f5ee243547dee91fbd053c1c4a845aa-Paper.pdf) paper. Both, the encoder and decoder consist of several multi-head attention layers, which are the backbone of this architecture. Since this tutorial is about FluidML, we won't go into the implementational details of a transformer model. We refer the interested reader to [Ben Trevett's tutorial on transformers for translation](https://github.com/bentrevett/pytorch-seq2seq/blob/master/6%20-%20Attention%20is%20All%20You%20Need.ipynb). Also, the pytorch transformer implementation used in this example is taken from Ben's tutorial.\n",

Due to its complexity the transformer model implementation is also imported in this notebook and can be found in the `transformer_model.py` script. The definition of the `set_seed()` function is also located in `transformer_seq2seq_translation.py`.\n",

    "You also might note that we use `self.resource.device` in our training task without explicitly defining it in the `__init__()` method. When initializing FluidML's main classes `Flow` and `Swarm`, the user can optionally provide a list of resources that will be made available to all tasks and processes. In a machine learning context such resources could be but are not limited to cuda devices (see this example). Below we will go through how to define and provide the list of resources to `Flow` and how the resources will be automatically distributed to tasks.\n",

    "### 1. Instantiate Task Specs\n",
    "`TaskSpec` is a simple wrapper class that allows specification of task details and task arguments which will be used during instantiation of the task.\n",
    "Let's go ahead and create specs for all our tasks.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Note 1**: If you want to do a grid search on a specific task, e.g. `TokenizerTraining` and `Training`, you should set the `expand` parameter either to `\"product\"` or `\"zip\"`. For a task where no hyperparameter tuning or grid search is required, `expand` should be set to `None` or simply not declared.\n",
    "\n",
    "Below we define for each task the necessary parameter dictionary which we feed into the task spec class.  \n",
    "\n",
    "**Note 2**: All parameters of a `TaskSpec` with the `expand` parameter set to `\"product\"` or `\"zip\"`, that are stored in a list, will be automatically expanded by `Flow` depending on the selected grid search expansion method. Namely, `expand=\"product\"` (default) will create different task instances for each explicit cross-product parameter combination. For example, considering the `Training` task, internally flow will instantiate 4 train tasks with the cross product combinations of different `train_batch_size` and `learning_rate`. Alternatively, `expand=\"zip\"` expands the config parameters by zipping over the different parameter lists. For example, `config = {\"learning_rate\": [0.1, 0.01, 0.001], \"batch_size\": [64, 128, 256]}` would expand to three distinct configs with the respective learning rates and batch sizes of `(0.1, 64), (0.01, 128), (0.001, 256)`. When choosing `\"zip\"` one has to make sure that all parameter lists are of equal lengths.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Note 3**: If you have to provide a parameter to a `TaskSpec` with the `expand` parameter set to `\"product\"` or `\"zip\"`, which is of type `List` and it should not get expanded, you have to wrap it again in a second list. E.g. `layer_dimensions: [[64, 128, 64]]`.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Note 4**: The `ModelSelection` task is a so called `reduce=True` task, which means it receives the combined input of all expanded direct predecessor tasks (in this case 4 train tasks)."
